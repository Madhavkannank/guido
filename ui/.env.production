# Production environment — used by `npm run build` and Cloudflare Pages builds.
#
# Split-deploy: React on Cloudflare Pages, API on Railway/Render/Fly.io
# Set VITE_API_BASE to your deployed API URL:
#   VITE_API_BASE=https://guido-api.railway.app
#
# If hosting API and UI on the SAME server (Docker):
#   leave VITE_API_BASE empty (relative URLs)
VITE_API_BASE=https://your-api.railway.app

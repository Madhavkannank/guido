# UI environment variables — copy to .env for local development.
# These are ONLY available at build time (Vite bakes them in at npm run build).

# API base URL for local dev. Vite's proxy (/api → :8000) means this works with or without it.
# For production Docker: leave empty in .env.production (same-origin relative URLs).
# For split-deploy (Vercel UI + Railway API): set full API URL here.

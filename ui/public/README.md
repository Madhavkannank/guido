Place your landing image here as `landing.jpg` so the app can display it in the hero.

To replace the brown panel in the hero quad with the image you provided, save that attachment as `quad-bl.jpg` in this folder. The app uses `/quad-bl.jpg` to fill the bottom-left panel.

Recommended size: 1600x1000 or larger for good coverage.

Do NOT commit sensitive images to the repository if they contain identifying patient data.

Fonts:
- To use a custom `Negan` font for the hero title, place `Negan.woff2` (preferred) or `Negan.woff` under `ui/public/fonts/`.
- The CSS will load `/fonts/Negan.woff2` automatically if present.
